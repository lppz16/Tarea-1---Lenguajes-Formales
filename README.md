## üìå Description  
This project implements the **deterministic finite automata (DFA) minimization algorithm** presented in *Kozen (1997), Lecture 14*.  
The program takes as input the definition of a DFA (without unreachable states) and determines the **equivalent states** that can be merged.  
Finally, it prints the pairs of equivalent states in lexicographic order.

## üì• Input Format  
1. One line with a number `c > 0` indicating the number of test cases.  
2. For each case:  
   - One line with `n > 0`, the number of DFA states.  
   - One line with the alphabet symbols separated by spaces.  
   - One line with the final states separated by spaces.  
   - `n` lines, each describing a row of the transition table for a state.  
     The symbols appear in the same order as they were listed in the alphabet line.  

---

## üì§ Output Format  
For each case, the program prints the **pairs of equivalent states** in lexicographic order.  
- The pairs are printed as `(p,q)` separated by spaces.  
- If there are no equivalent pairs, a blank line is printed.
